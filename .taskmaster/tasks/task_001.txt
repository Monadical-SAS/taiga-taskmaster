# Task ID: 1
# Title: Fix Type Safety Violation in Stream Error Types
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace the 'unknown' error type in streamLines function with proper error types to maintain Effect's type safety guarantees.
# Details:
1. Identify all possible error types that can occur during command execution
2. Create proper error type definitions if they don't exist
3. Update the streamLines function signature to use union types of specific errors:
```typescript
readonly streamLines: (command: Command.Command) => Stream.Stream<string, CommandExecutionError | FileSystemError | TimeoutError>;
```
4. Ensure all implementations of this interface properly handle and propagate these error types
5. Update any consumers of this API to handle the specific error types

# Test Strategy:
1. Write unit tests that verify errors are properly typed and propagated
2. Create test scenarios that trigger each error type
3. Verify that TypeScript compiler catches incompatible error handling
4. Test error recovery paths to ensure they work with the new typed errors

# Task ID: 3
# Title: Fix Command Parsing Logic
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace naive space-splitting command parsing with a proper approach that handles quoted arguments and complex shell commands.
# Details:
1. Remove string concatenation in command creation:
```typescript
// Instead of returning a string from createGooseCommand
const createGooseCommand = (args: string[]): Command.Command => ({
  cmd: 'goose',
  args: args
});

// Update command executor to work with structured commands
const executeCommand = ({ cmd, args }: Command.Command) => {
  // Use cmd and args directly without string manipulation
}
```
2. Update all command creation functions to return structured Command objects
3. Modify command execution to use the structured format
4. Remove any string splitting/joining operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test commands with quoted arguments (e.g., `echo "hello world"`)
2. Test commands with special characters
3. Verify complex commands are correctly parsed and executed
4. Create integration tests that verify real command execution matches expected behavior

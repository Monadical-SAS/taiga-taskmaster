# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Initial Configuration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a new project repository with recommended tech stack and basic configuration.
# Details:
Create a new repository using Node.js (v18+), Express.js (v4.18+), and React (v18+). Set up ESLint, Prettier, and a basic CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions). Use TypeScript for both backend and frontend. Initialize a package.json and tsconfig.json. Install core dependencies: express, react, react-dom, typescript, @types/node, @types/react, @types/react-dom.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository setup by running initial build scripts and linting. Ensure CI pipeline runs on push.

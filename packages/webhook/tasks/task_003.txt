# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement User Registration API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop backend API for user registration.
# Details:
Create an Express route POST /api/auth/register. Validate input (email, password, name). Hash password with bcrypt. Save user to database. Return success/error response. Use express-validator (v7+) for input validation.

# Test Strategy:
Test registration with valid/invalid inputs. Verify user is saved and password is hashed. Check for duplicate email.

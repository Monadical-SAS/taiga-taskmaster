# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Tag Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create utilities for generating, validating, and extracting information from Taiga task tags according to the PRD specifications.
# Details:
1. Implement tag utilities in the common package following the established architecture
2. Create functions for:
   - Generating taskmaster tags with proper format
   - Extracting master task IDs from tags
   - Validating tag formats
   - Finding master IDs in arrays of tags
   - Creating project-specific tags
3. Add proper error handling for invalid inputs
4. Create unit tests for all tag utilities
5. Ensure compatibility with the Taiga API requirements
6. Integrate with the existing type system using branded types

The implementation should leverage the existing type system and follow functional programming patterns.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test tag creation with various task IDs
2. Verify project tag format is correct
3. Test extraction of master IDs from valid and invalid tags
4. Test finding master IDs in arrays of mixed tags
5. Verify validation of taskmaster tags
6. Test error handling when PROJECT_SLUG is not set
7. Test with edge cases like very large IDs or special characters in project slugs
8. Verify integration with branded types

# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Docker Containerization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: low
# Description: Create Docker configuration for containerized deployment of the application.
# Details:
1. Create Dockerfile for the application
2. Set up multi-stage build for optimization
3. Create docker-compose.yml for local development
4. Add volume mounts for persistent data
5. Configure environment variables
6. Set up health checks
7. Implement graceful shutdown handling
8. Create Docker-specific documentation

The Docker configuration should support both development and production environments.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Docker image builds successfully
2. Test container startup with various environment configurations
3. Verify volume mounting for persistent data
4. Test container restart behavior
5. Verify application functionality within container
6. Test with docker-compose
7. Verify logs are correctly written to mounted volumes
8. Test container resource usage under load

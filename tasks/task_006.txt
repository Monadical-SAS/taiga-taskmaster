# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Task Generation Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a service that implements the taskmaster-interface to generate tasks from PRD content using the claude-task-master CLI tool.
# Details:
1. Implement the `GenerateTasksF` interface defined in the taskmaster-interface package
2. Create wrapper around the claude-task-master CLI tool
3. Implement file system operations for temporary files
4. Add proper error handling and cleanup
5. Implement validation of generated tasks using the existing schemas
6. Create unit tests with mocked dependencies
7. Add logging for debugging and monitoring
8. Implement resource cleanup for proper resource management

The implementation should follow the interface contract and leverage the existing type system.

# Test Strategy:
1. Mock file system operations to test task generation without actual file I/O
2. Test handling of claude-task-master CLI execution with mocked exec function
3. Verify proper cleanup of temporary files
4. Test validation of generated tasks file
5. Test error handling for various failure scenarios (file write errors, CLI execution errors, validation errors)
6. Test with various PRD content inputs
7. Verify atomic transaction behavior
8. Verify conformance to the GenerateTasksF interface

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Task Generation Service Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the GenerateTasksF interface from the taskmaster-interface package.
### Details:
Implement the GenerateTasksF interface with all required methods and properties. Ensure the implementation correctly handles task generation from PRD content. Focus on meeting the interface contract requirements while allowing for flexible implementation approaches.

## 2. Develop CLI Tool Wrapper with Execution Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a wrapper around the CLI tool that handles process execution, command-line arguments, and output parsing.
### Details:
Implement functionality to execute the claude-task-master CLI tool. Handle command-line argument formatting, environment variables, and working directory configuration. Implement robust error handling for process failures, timeouts, and unexpected outputs. Parse and transform the CLI output into the required task data structures.

## 3. Implement File System Operations for Temporary Files [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create utilities to manage temporary files needed during the task generation process.
### Details:
Develop functionality to create, write to, read from, and delete temporary files. Implement path generation for temporary files with unique identifiers. Handle file system exceptions appropriately. Create helper functions for common file operations used in the task generation workflow.

## 4. Implement Validation of Generated Tasks [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.3
### Description: Create validation logic to ensure generated tasks meet the required format and content specifications.
### Details:
Implement validation for task structure, content, and relationships using the existing schemas. Create validation rules for task properties such as title, description, and dependencies. Implement error collection and reporting mechanisms. Ensure validation failures provide clear, actionable error messages.

## 5. Implement Resource Cleanup [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Implement proper resource cleanup to ensure all resources are properly managed and released.
### Details:
Create cleanup logic for temporary files, process handles, and other resources. Add safeguards to prevent resource leaks in error scenarios. Ensure all resources are properly released when they are no longer needed. Document the resource management approach for maintainers.

## 6. Create Unit Tests with Mocked Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Develop comprehensive unit tests for the Task Generation Service using mocked dependencies.
### Details:
Create tests for the task generation implementation with mocked dependencies. Implement tests for successful task generation scenarios. Add tests for error handling, validation failures, and edge cases. Create mocks for file system, CLI tool execution, and other external dependencies. Implement tests to verify proper resource cleanup.

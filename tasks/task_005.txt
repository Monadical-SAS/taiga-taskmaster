# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement PRD Webhook Receiver Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the webhook endpoint that receives PRD updates from Taiga and initiates the task generation process, implementing the existing interfaces.
# Details:
1. Implement Express endpoint for receiving webhook payloads
2. Add JWT validation middleware for security
3. Implement payload validation using the existing schemas
4. Create controller that connects to the core business logic
5. Add error handling and logging
6. Implement PRD swimlane validation
7. Connect to the task generation service through the established interfaces
8. Create unit tests with mocked dependencies

The implementation should use dependency injection and follow the interface contracts defined in the core package.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test webhook endpoint with valid and invalid payloads
2. Mock Taiga client to test swimlane validation
3. Test JWT validation middleware with valid and invalid tokens
4. Verify error handling for various failure scenarios
5. Test integration with task generator through the interfaces
6. Verify correct HTTP status codes are returned
7. Test handling of edge cases like malformed JSON
8. Verify conformance to interface contracts

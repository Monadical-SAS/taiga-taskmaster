# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Markdown Rendering Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a service to transform task data into formatted Markdown content for Taiga task descriptions.
# Details:
1. Implement markdown rendering utilities in the common package
2. Create functions for:
   - Rendering subtasks as markdown
   - Generating dependency diagrams using Mermaid
   - Rendering complete task descriptions
3. Add proper error handling for invalid inputs
4. Create unit tests for all rendering functions
5. Ensure compatibility with Taiga markdown rendering
6. Optimize for readability and visual clarity

The implementation should leverage the existing type system and follow functional programming patterns.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test rendering of subtasks with various combinations of optional fields
2. Verify dependency diagram generation with different dependency structures
3. Test handling of missing tasks in dependency references
4. Verify complete task rendering with all components
5. Test with edge cases like very long titles or descriptions
6. Verify Mermaid syntax is correctly generated
7. Test with tasks that have no dependencies
8. Verify integration with the existing type system

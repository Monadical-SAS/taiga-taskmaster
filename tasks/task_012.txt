# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement CLI Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 8, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a command-line interface for manual task generation and synchronization.
# Details:
1. Implement CLI using Commander or a similar library
2. Create commands for:
   - Generating tasks from a PRD file
   - Syncing tasks with Taiga
   - Validating task files
   - Managing configuration
3. Add proper error handling and logging
4. Implement help text and documentation
5. Create progress indicators for long-running operations
6. Add validation of command arguments
7. Implement colorized output for better readability

The implementation should leverage the existing modules through their interfaces.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test CLI command parsing with various arguments
2. Verify file reading and writing operations
3. Test task generation with sample PRD files
4. Test task synchronization with sample tasks files
5. Verify error handling for invalid inputs
6. Test with missing or invalid arguments
7. Verify integration with task generator and synchronizer modules through their interfaces
8. Test help text and documentation accuracy

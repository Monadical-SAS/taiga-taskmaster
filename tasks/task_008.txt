# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Taiga Synchronizer Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a service that implements the tasktracker-interface to synchronize generated tasks with Taiga, handling creation, updates, and conflict resolution.
# Details:
1. Implement the `SyncTasksF` interface defined in the tasktracker-interface package
2. Create functions for:
   - Finding existing tasks by master ID
   - Creating new tasks in Taiga
   - Updating existing tasks
   - Managing swimlanes
   - Handling batch operations
3. Implement retry logic for API failures
4. Add dead letter queue for failed operations
5. Implement proper error handling and logging
6. Create unit tests with mocked dependencies
7. Add rate limiting protection

The implementation should follow the interface contract and leverage the existing HTTP client and type system.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test task mapping from file content to tracker tasks
2. Mock Taiga client to test finding existing tasks
3. Test swimlane management (getting and creating)
4. Verify batch processing with different batch sizes
5. Test retry mechanism for failed operations
6. Verify dead letter queue functionality for persistently failing tasks
7. Test full synchronization workflow with various scenarios (new tasks, existing tasks, mixed)
8. Test handling of API rate limits
9. Verify conflict resolution strategy
10. Verify conformance to the SyncTasksF interface

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement SyncTasksF Interface Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement the core structure of the SyncTasksF interface that will handle task synchronization with Taiga.
### Details:
Implement the SyncTasksF interface with the required synchronization operations. Include necessary dependencies for Taiga API communication, configuration, and logging. Define the main synchronization method that will orchestrate the entire process.

## 2. Develop Task Finding and Matching Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create algorithms to find and match tasks between the local system and Taiga.
### Details:
Implement logic to query Taiga for existing tasks. Develop matching algorithms based on unique identifiers, titles, or other metadata. Create a mapping structure to maintain relationships between local and Taiga tasks. Handle edge cases like duplicate tasks or partially matched tasks.

## 3. Implement Task Creation and Update Operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Build functionality to create new tasks in Taiga and update existing ones based on local changes.
### Details:
Implement methods to transform local task models to Taiga-compatible formats. Create operations for task creation with all required fields. Develop update logic that identifies changed fields and only updates necessary data. Implement conflict resolution strategies for concurrent modifications.

## 4. Develop Swimlane Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Create functionality to manage Taiga swimlanes for organized task visualization.
### Details:
Implement methods to query existing swimlanes in Taiga. Create operations to create new swimlanes when needed. Develop logic to assign tasks to appropriate swimlanes based on task metadata or status. Handle swimlane updates when task properties change.

## 5. Implement Batch Processing with Rate Limiting [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Build a system for processing tasks in batches while respecting Taiga API rate limits.
### Details:
Create a batch processing mechanism that groups tasks for efficient API calls. Implement rate limiting logic to prevent API throttling. Develop monitoring for API response headers to dynamically adjust request rates. Create a queuing system for pending operations when rate limits are reached.

## 6. Implement Retry Logic and Dead Letter Queue [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.5
### Description: Create robust error handling with retry mechanisms and a dead letter queue for failed synchronizations.
### Details:
Implement exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures. Create a dead letter queue to store tasks that repeatedly fail synchronization. Develop monitoring and alerting for DLQ items. Implement manual retry capabilities for administrators. Create detailed error logging for troubleshooting.

## 7. Create Unit Tests for Synchronization Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6
### Description: Develop comprehensive unit tests covering various synchronization scenarios and edge cases.
### Details:
Create tests for successful task creation and updates. Implement tests for error handling and retry logic. Develop tests for rate limiting behavior. Create tests for conflict resolution scenarios. Implement integration tests with mocked Taiga API responses. Create performance tests for batch processing.

# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Unit and Integration Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive test suite for all modules and components of the system.
# Details:
1. Implement unit tests for all modules
2. Create integration tests for key workflows
3. Add end-to-end tests for complete system
4. Implement test utilities and mocks
5. Set up test coverage reporting
6. Create test fixtures and sample data
7. Implement property-based testing for critical components
8. Add performance tests for key operations

The tests should verify both the interfaces and implementations, ensuring the system works correctly as a whole.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for all utility functions
2. Test each module in isolation with mocked dependencies
3. Create integration tests for key workflows
4. Test error handling and edge cases
5. Verify code coverage meets thresholds
6. Test with both valid and invalid inputs
7. Create end-to-end tests for complete workflows
8. Test performance with large datasets
9. Verify interface conformance for all implementations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up test utilities and mock creation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop reusable test utilities, fixtures, and mock objects to support all testing efforts
### Details:
Create a comprehensive test utilities package that includes: mock data generators, test fixtures, assertion helpers, and mock implementations of external dependencies. Set up the testing framework configuration and establish patterns for creating consistent mocks across all test suites.

## 2. Implement unit tests for core utilities and functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Create thorough unit tests for all core utility functions and isolated components
### Details:
Write unit tests for all core utility functions, ensuring high code coverage. Test edge cases, error handling, and normal operation paths. Focus on testing each function in isolation with appropriate mocks. Include tests for data transformations, validation logic, and helper functions.

## 3. Develop integration tests for key workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Create integration tests that verify interactions between multiple components
### Details:
Implement integration tests for key workflows that span multiple components. Test the interaction between components, ensuring they work together correctly. Focus on critical paths through the system, including data flow between modules, state transitions, and component interactions.

## 4. Create end-to-end tests for complete system [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.3
### Description: Develop comprehensive end-to-end tests that verify the entire system works correctly
### Details:
Build end-to-end tests that exercise the complete system from user input to final output. Create test scenarios that mimic real user workflows. Include tests for UI interactions, API calls, database operations, and any external service integrations. Ensure tests run in an environment that closely resembles production.

## 5. Implement property-based testing for critical components [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Use property-based testing to verify invariants and properties of critical system components
### Details:
Apply property-based testing techniques to critical components where traditional example-based testing is insufficient. Define properties that should hold true for all valid inputs. Generate random test cases to verify these properties. Focus on components with complex logic, data transformations, or algorithmic implementations.

## 6. Set up performance testing for key operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3, 13.4
### Description: Create performance tests to ensure system meets performance requirements
### Details:
Develop performance tests for key operations and critical paths. Establish performance baselines and thresholds. Test system behavior under various load conditions. Measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization. Implement automated performance regression testing to catch performance degradations early.

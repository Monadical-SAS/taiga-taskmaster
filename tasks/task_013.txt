# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Unit and Integration Tests
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive test suite for all modules and components of the system.
# Details:
1. Implement unit tests for all modules
2. Create integration tests for key workflows
3. Add end-to-end tests for complete system
4. Implement test utilities and mocks
5. Set up test coverage reporting
6. Create test fixtures and sample data
7. Implement property-based testing for critical components
8. Add performance tests for key operations

The tests should verify both the interfaces and implementations, ensuring the system works correctly as a whole.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for all utility functions
2. Test each module in isolation with mocked dependencies
3. Create integration tests for key workflows
4. Test error handling and edge cases
5. Verify code coverage meets thresholds
6. Test with both valid and invalid inputs
7. Create end-to-end tests for complete workflows
8. Test performance with large datasets
9. Verify interface conformance for all implementations

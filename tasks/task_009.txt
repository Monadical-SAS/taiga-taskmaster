# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Error Handling and Logging System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a robust error handling and logging system to track and manage failures throughout the application.
# Details:
1. Implement a centralized logging system using Effect or a similar library
2. Create custom error types with proper categorization
3. Implement global error handlers
4. Add dead letter queue for failed operations
5. Create structured logging with different levels
6. Implement file-based and console logging
7. Add context-aware error handling
8. Create utilities for error reporting and monitoring

The implementation should integrate with the existing architecture and follow functional programming patterns.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test logger with different log levels and message types
2. Verify log files are created with correct formats
3. Test custom error types with various error scenarios
4. Verify global error handlers catch unhandled exceptions and rejections
5. Test dead letter queue with different item types and error scenarios
6. Verify error details are properly captured and formatted
7. Test integration with other modules to ensure errors are properly logged
8. Verify context is properly maintained in error handling

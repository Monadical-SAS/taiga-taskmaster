```

### 6.7. Multiple resolution

To resolve the multiple ids you can send a GET mixing parameters from the previous examples:

```bash
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
```

The response body is a JSON object containing the project and the task ids

```json
"project": 1,
"task": 1,
"us": 1,
"wikipage": 1
```

### 6.8. By ref value

To resolve an object if we donâ€™t know its type we have to use `ref` GET parameter:

```bash
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \
```

The response body is a JSON object containing the project and the story, task or
issue id.

```json
"project": 1,
"task": 1
```

Incompatibility between GET params
Be careful because `ref` is inconpatible with `us`, `task` and `issue`
parameters in requests with multiple resolutions.

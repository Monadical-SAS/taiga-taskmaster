### 13.1. List

To list milestones send a GET request with the following parameters:

```bash
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ${AUTH_TOKEN}" \

The HTTP response is a 200 OK and the response body is a JSON list of [milestone detail objects](https://docs.taiga.io/api.html#object-milestone-detail)
